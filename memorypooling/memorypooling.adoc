== Memory Pooling in Low-Latency Systems

Memory pooling, also known as object pooling, is a memory management technique commonly used in low-latency systems to efficiently allocate and deallocate memory for frequently used objects. It minimizes the overhead of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation, which can introduce latency and memory fragmentation.

Here's how memory pooling works:

1. Initialization: A pool of memory is preallocated during system initialization. This memory pool is typically a contiguous block of memory.

2. Object Allocation: When an object is needed, it is retrieved from the memory pool rather than allocating memory dynamically. Objects in the pool are organized into data structures like linked lists or arrays for efficient access.

3. Object Deallocation: When an object is no longer needed, it is returned to the memory pool for future reuse, rather than being deallocated or freed.

Benefits of memory pooling in low-latency systems:

- Reduced Latency: Memory allocation and deallocation times are minimized because objects are reused from the pool, eliminating the overhead of heap management.

- Predictable Performance: Memory pooling can help maintain predictable and consistent performance since it avoids the occasional performance spikes associated with dynamic memory allocation.

- Mitigation of Memory Fragmentation: Memory fragmentation issues, which can degrade performance over time, are mitigated because memory is allocated in fixed-size blocks.

- Improved Cache Locality: Memory pooling can improve cache locality because objects are often allocated in a contiguous block, enhancing memory access patterns.

- Control over Resource Usage: Memory pools allow for precise control over resource usage, which is valuable in resource-constrained environments.

- Customization: Memory pooling can be customized to allocate objects of different sizes and types, making it suitable for various use cases.
